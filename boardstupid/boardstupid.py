        An instance of GameState has the following attributes.

            player: Set as either 1 (MAX) or -1 (MIN).
            moves: A tuple of integers representing empty indices of the board.
            selected: The index that the current player believes to be their
                      optimal move; defaults to -1.
            util: The utility of the board; either 1 (MAX wins), -1 (MIN wins),
                  0 (tie game), or None (non-terminal game state).
            traverse: A callable that takes an integer as its only argument to
                      be used as the index to apply a move on the board,
                      returning a new GameState object with this move applied.
                      This callable provides a means to traverse the game tree
                      without modifying parent states.
            display: A string representation of the board, which should only be
                     used for debugging and not parsed for strategy.

        In addition, instances of GameState may be stored in hashed
        collections, such as sets or dictionaries.
